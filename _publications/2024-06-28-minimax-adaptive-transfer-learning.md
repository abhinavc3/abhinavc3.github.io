This paper considers minimax and adaptive transfer learning for nonparametric classification under the posterior drift model with distributed differential privacy constraints. Our study is conducted within a heterogeneous framework, encompassing diverse sample sizes, varying privacy parameters, and data heterogeneity across different servers.

We first establish the minimax misclassification rate, precisely characterizing the effects of privacy constraints, source samples, and target samples on classification accuracy. The results reveal interesting phase transition phenomena and highlight the intricate trade-offs between preserving privacy and achieving classification accuracy.

We then develop a data-driven adaptive classifier that achieves the optimal rate within a logarithmic factor across a large collection of parameter spaces while satisfying the same set of differential privacy constraints. Simulation studies and real-world data applications further elucidate the theoretical analysis with numerical results.
